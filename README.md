# COMMODORE 64 User's Guide Examples in Machine Language

[![Build C64 Binaries](https://github.com/lacerto/c64_users_guide_examples/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lacerto/c64_users_guide_examples/actions/workflows/build.yml)
## Description

This repository contains a subset of the BASIC examples found in the **COMMODORE 64 User's Guide** converted to assembly language.
The examples therefore make heavy use of the **BASIC** and **KERNAL** ROMs of the C64.

## Goals

My first contact with assembly language programming was on the C64. I was a kid at the time, so I did not understand a lot of the things that were described in a large red book I had with many assembly examples.  
Now as an adult I want to understand more about 6510 assembly and as a starting point I thought why not read the User's Guide and try to replicate the BASIC programs in assembly? Unfortunately I do not have my C64 anymore, but there are great emulators out there.

You ask yourself why someone learns how to program the *ancient* C64? It's a great hobby and hobbies do not have to produce something useful. It's fun.

## Tools

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
There are a couple of extensions that provide syntax highlighting for 6502.

[Turbo Macro Pro Cross Assembler (TMPx)](http://turbo.style64.org/)

[VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)
